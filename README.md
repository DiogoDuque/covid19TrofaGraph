# Covid19 @ Trofa
If you are looking for the dashboard with all the charts, go [here](https://diogoduque.github.io/covid19TrofaGraph/).

This is a small project I made to easily see some simple but specific statistics about the Covid19 state of things in my area.
The [dssg-pt/covid19pt-data](https://github.com/dssg-pt/covid19pt-data) repo is used as a data source.

## To run it locally
```bash
# install
npm i
# run
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


## Deploy
```bash
npm run deploy
```


## Future ideas
* Death/recovered cases evolution chart
* Table, split by age group, with absolute number of infecteds and also relative when comparing to demographics of age group
