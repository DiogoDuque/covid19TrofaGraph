# Covid19 @ Trofa


This is a small project I made to easily see some simple but specific statistics about the Covid19 state of things in my area.
The [dssg-pt/covid19pt-data](https://github.com/dssg-pt/covid19pt-data) repo is used as a data source.

[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/DiogoDuque/covid19TrofaGraph/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DiogoDuque/covid19TrofaGraph/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

## To run it locally
```bash
# install
npm i
# run
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


## Deploy

```
